This Branch Contains the Tractive System Status Indicator (TSSI) board Schematic and PCB

Description:

The TSSI indicates via an array of Red/Green Light the status of the Tractive System (ETC).
In the event that there is a falure In either the BMS or IMD as signaled by the ETC
board the indicator will flash Red at ~2Hz signaling the driver and crew that the vehicle
is fault. The function of the board is also to hold the Ready-To-Drive-Sound (RTDS) Piezo and 
Ready-To-Drive-Light(s) RTDL where logic and power for both indicators is off of the ETC board.
